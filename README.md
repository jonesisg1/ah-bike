# Astro / HTMX Bike 

An app for bike shops to show what they have in stock.  
- PostgreSQL database backend.  PL/pgSQL stored procedures create hypermedia.
- PostgREST as database API secured using JWTs and accessed by HTMX.
- AWS Cognito authentication.
- Shoelace web components to make it look nice.
- Astro ties it together and provides bundling and easy deployment.
- The data has been scraped using Puppeteer (separate project!).

```sh
npm install
/* ToDo: database migration scripts. */
```

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
